# Linux
- The history of Linux goes back to 1991 when a Finnish graduate programmer Linus Torvalds began to work on his own operating system kernel.
- He put his work on a public server and it became a milestone in the history of Linux. First dozens, then hundreds and thousands of developers supported his project, and thatâ€™s how a complete operating system was born.
- The first official version of Linux 1.0 was released in 1994. From the beginning to the present day, Linux has been distributed as free software under the GPL license. This means that the source code of the operating system can be seen by anyone - and not only seen but also modified. The only condition is that the changed, modified code must also be available to everybody and distributed under the GPL. This is important because it allows developers to use the code and at the same time not be afraid of copyright issues.
- Today, Linux is the best known and most used open-source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is a software that is underneath other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and passing those requests to the computer's hardware.
# Administration
- Administration is, without going into too much detail, the support and improvement of all computer and office equipment, peripheral devices, network connectivity, etc. When administering Linux, most of the work is done in the terminal, so it's better to start with basic utilities.
# Virtual machines
- A virtual machine (VM) is just like a physical computer, it has a CPU, memory, disks for storing files, and can connect to the Internet if necessary. The only difference is that the components of your computer (the hardware) are tangible, while virtual machines exist only as code.
- To put it simply, it's a virtual computer on which you can install an operating system and all the associated software, with no changes to your main operating system.
- Virtualisation is the process of creating a software (virtual) version of a computer with dedicated CPU, memory and storage resources that are "borrowed" from a physical computer. A virtual machine is a computer file (image) that works like a normal computer.
- VirtualBox is a virtualisation software product, i.e. a tool for creating virtual machines.
